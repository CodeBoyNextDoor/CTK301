      <p class="customtext"> On December 31 1999 a handsome baby boy was born name Jalen D McClellan!
        Mother (Shauntee) & Father (Johnny), this was his mothers first child
        doctors told her the chances were slim to none of producing a baby. Father Johnny
        was working on his 3rd baby boy Jalen would be his 4th child! Jalen was Born
        at chirst hospital in Chicago Il.Jalen was a very happy & loving baby would enjoy eating & playing</p>
        <p class="p4"> Fast foward as Jalen blossom his family lives in a house on the south side of Chicago. Where he has 5 dogs to keep him busy before attending school
          Jalen also lived in a house with two of his siblings Candace & Cameron. They were twins who always protected Jalen & never let harm come his way! In this house they would play
          fight & do silly things children would normally do. Candace & Cameron would teach Jalen everything they learned from school since they were older.Jalen life was an Europhia in this house.
          </p>
            <p class="embox">Fastword Jalen becomes 10 & his Europhia ends. Parents gets a divorice which leads to heartbreaks at home. Jalen would have never thought he would be alone. At least he alwasy could come home to Cadance & Cameron. Soon Jalen would find
              that to be a myth. Jalen & his mom Moved to  the east side of Chicago. A rougher neighborhood that the last. Jalen would pressure hiself to hide his feelings while trying to adapt to something so new.His mom didnt want him to attend any new
              neighborhood schools so she sent him to a charter school 1hour away. Jalen learned good discipline from waking up early to being punctual & prepared. Jalen made the basektball team at the school. He had to chose to act or play ball! It was
              a tough decions but Jalen found basketball to help him through pain. Some odd reason he quit one day & never returned until his freshmen year of highschool.</p>
