      <p class="customtext"> On December 31 1999 around 1:08pm, a handsome baby boy was born by the name of Jalen D McClellan!
        First child to his mother (Shauntee) & fourth child to his father (Johnny).
        Doctors told Jalen mom she had a slim to none chance of having a baby. Jalen was born
        at the Univieristy of Chicago in Chicago,Il.Jalen was a very happy & loving baby! He most enjoyed eating & playing with his siblings.</p>
        <p class="p4"> Fast foward as Jalen blossom, his family moves to a house on the south side of Chicago. Where he had acciqured 5 dogs to keep him busy before attending school.
          Jalen also shared a room with two of his siblings Candace & Cameron. These two were twins that always protected Jalen & never let harm come his way! In this house they would play
          fight & do silly things that children normally do. Candace & Cameron would teach Jalen everything they learned from school since they were older.Jalen life was an dream in this house.
          </p>
            <p class="embox">Fastword Jalen becomes 10 & his dream ends. Parents gets a divorice which leads to major heartbreaks at home. Jalen has never thought he would be alone. At least he could always come home to Cadance & Cameron. Soon Jalen would find
              that to be a myth. Jalen & his mom moved to the east side of Chicago. A rougher neighborhood than the last. Jalen would pressure hiself to hide his feelings while trying to adapt to something so new.His mom didn't want him to attend any
              neighborhood school in that area. So she sent him to a charter school 1 hour away. Jalen learned good discipline from waking up early to being punctual & prepared. The most exicting meomory Jalen  has is making the basektball team at the school. He had a choice of acting or basektball! It was
              a tough decions but Jalen found basketball to help him through pain. Some odd reason he quit one day & never returned until his freshmen year of highschool.</p>
